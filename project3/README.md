# Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree - Project 3

We solved the challenge to persist our blockchain dataset. Our next challenge is to build a RESTful API using a Node.js framework that will interface with our private blockchain.

By configuring an API for your private blockchain you expose functionality that can be consumed by several types of web clients ranging from desktop, mobile, and IoT devices.

For your next project, you will be creating a RESTful web API for your private blockchain. The API project will require two endpoints:

* Get block
* Post block

## Select Node.js framework

For the development of the project we used the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/).

## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

## Run the project

```
node app.js
```

## Project endpoints

Several tools are available on the internet to assist with API development and testing. If your having troubles testing your endpoints, try one of the tools listed below:

* Postman is a powerful tool used to test web services. It was developed for sending HTTP requests in a simple and quick way.
* CURL is a command-line tool used to deliver requests supporting a variety of protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and many more.

_Get block endpoint:_

```
http://localhost:8000/block/:index
```

Curl example:

```
curl "http://localhost:8000/block/0"
```

_Post block endpoint:_
```
http://localhost:8000/block
```

Curl example:
```
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8000/block" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
  "body": "Testing block with test string data"
}'
```
